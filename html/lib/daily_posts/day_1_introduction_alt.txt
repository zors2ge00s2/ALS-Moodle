<p>Welcome to our new <b>ALS Mindfulness Program</b>! We appreciate your time, and we hope you will find this program helpful. We designed activities using over 40 years of research about how one can use mindfulness to increase feelings of control over one's
    health and one's quality of life. This program customizes these activities for the ALS community in an online format that we hope is easy to understand and to use.</p>
<p>What do you hope to accomplish over the next three weeks? We will be sending you text and simple exercises designed to promote mindfulness. Our research demonstrates that mindfulness <b>promotes well-being and quality of
life, </b>in particular when facing challenging situations, as experienced after a diagnosis of ALS. We have preliminary evidence showing that when people with ALS increase their mindfulness, a reduction in both anxiety and depression follows along with
    an increase in quality of life. The same appears to be the case for relatives and others with close relationships. We also found that mindfulness positively influenced the change in physical symptoms; that is, more mindful people appeared to experience
    a slower progression of the disease.</p>
<p>Sometimes when people think about mindfulness, they think about meditation. Meditation is one way to improve mindfulness, though it is not necessarily the most efficient way, and often not the easiest. Dr. Langer discovered that <b>becoming mindful is much easier than most
people realize</b>. It does not require a long intensive training period. Instead, it uses simple cognitive activities to open a whole new world of possibility. This program will provide you with activities that cover critical aspects of a mindful approach
    to your health.
