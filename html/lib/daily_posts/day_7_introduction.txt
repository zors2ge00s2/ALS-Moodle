    <p>Welcome to Day 7!</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Today you'll be able to practice the key concepts of the first week: &nbsp;noticing that things are always changing and our reactions to those things as being positive versus negative, and even a quick glimpse into how to embrace the possibilities that
        come with the unpredictability in our lives.</p>
    <p><br>

    <p>Enjoy!</p><br></p>
