<p>Welcome to Day 13 of the program!<br><br>
</p>
<p>Today we'll introduce how we can make sense of the things that we see and hear that may seem puzzling or otherwise confusing. &nbsp;Weâ€™ll look at how we practice making sense of things and why we often react to things "automatically".
    <p> We'll look at some ideas for how to find more than one way to make sense of things.</p>

</p>
<p>You'll start with a brief video and then begin! &nbsp;</p>
