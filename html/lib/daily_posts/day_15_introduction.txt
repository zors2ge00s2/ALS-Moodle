    <p>By this time you have been introduced to most of the key concepts in mindfulness as we study it. &nbsp;Tomorrow you'll hear about "Novelty" or "Creativity" in our everyday lives. &nbsp;
<p>Today, and for the remainder of the course, you'll
        continue to immerse yourself in activities that reinforce the ideas you've already learned and think about how to apply them in your own life. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>Remember there are no right or wrong answers; the idea is to look at the world in multiple ways, which helps reduce stress, eliminate the constant judging that we do about ourselves and other people, and see that the variations in our lives and in
        the lives of our loved ones brings with it the possibilities not yet imagined. &nbsp;With change and unpredictability, we learn that nothing is for certain. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br></p>
