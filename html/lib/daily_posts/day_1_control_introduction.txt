Welcome!
<br><br>
We hope you will find this program engaging and valuable. For the next three weeks, you'll learn both theory and practice in the research on ALS and some mindful applications to help both persons with ALS and their primary carers. 
<br><br>
The program is customized in an online format for easy use. You'll see videos and will be offered some simple exercises (mental, social, and sometimes physical) designed to engage you on your own and with others.  There are a variety of ways to become more mindful and early evidence shows that when people with ALS increase their mindfulness, their quality of life increases.

Most of the sources of information are from XYZ.

Enjoy the program!
