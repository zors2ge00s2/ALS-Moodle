Welcome!
<br><br>
We hope you will find this program engaging and valuable. For the next three weeks, you'll experience exercises that apply over 40 years of research. Our research shows that living a more mindful life has the benefits of increasing our feelings of control over our health and quality of life.
<br><br>
The program is customized in an online format for easy use. You'll see videos and will play with simple exercises (mental, social, and sometimes physical) designed to promote mindfulness. We tested this recently with people after an ALS diagnosis. Early evidence shows that <b> when people with ALS increase their mindfulness, their quality of life increases.</b> There's even early evidence that more mindful individuals appeared to experience slower disease progression.
<br><br>
Dr. Ellen Langer, the "mother of mindfulness" and the program's creator, discovered that <b>becoming mindful is much easier than most people realize. </b> It does not require a long intensive training period or meditation. Instead, it helps people become more flexible in their thinking and unlocks a world of possibility.

Enjoy the program!
