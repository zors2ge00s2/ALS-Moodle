moodle-availability_relativedate
==============================================
Relative dates will be experimental in Moodle 3.8. Until then we can restrict module and section
access based on a relative date.

This availability condition makes it easy to show modules or sections only x days/weeks/months
  - after course start date
  - before course end date
  - after user enrolment date
  - after end of enrloment period

Check the global documentation about availability conditions : https://docs.moodle.org/en/Conditional_activities_settings

Installation:

 1. Unpack the zip file into the availability/condition/ directory. A new directory will be created called relativedate.
 2. Go to Site administration > Notifications to complete the plugin installation.
