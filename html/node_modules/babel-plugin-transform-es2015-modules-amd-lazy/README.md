# babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-amd-lazy

This Babel transform is a fork of the [Babel AMD transform](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-amd-lazy/src) that will only AMD-ify a file if it contains an `import` or `export` (or `export default`).

If you have a legitimate use case where you have source files without imports or exports that should still be transformed to AMD modules, or if you have a pure ES2015 codebase, then this plugin probably isn't for you.

This plugin is mainly useful in a transitional codebase where you have a combination of ES2015, existing AMD modules and scripts that aren't either, and you only want the ES2015 modules transformed to AMD.
